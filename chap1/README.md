## ðŸ§  Conclusion
The results show that **multiprocessing performs faster** than **multithreading** for this CPU-intensive calculation.  
This is because **processes run on separate CPU cores**, enabling true parallel execution, while **threads share the same memory space** and are limited by Pythonâ€™s **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**.  

In summary, for **CPU-bound tasks**, multiprocessing is more efficient, whereas **multithreading** is better suited for **I/O-bound operations**.
