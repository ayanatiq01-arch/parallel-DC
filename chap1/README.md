# Step 1: Go to Desktop (or your desired location)
cd Desktop
# Moves your terminal to the Desktop directory where your project will be cloned.

# Step 2: Clone your GitHub repository
git clone https://github.com/ayanatiq01-arch/parallel-DC.git
# Downloads (clones) your remote GitHub repo to your computer.

# Step 3: Enter the cloned project folder
cd parallel-DC
# Opens the cloned repository so we can work inside it.

# Step 4: Create a new folder called 'chap1'
mkdir chap1
# Makes a folder named chap1 to store files related to this chapter.

# Step 5: Move into the 'chap1' folder
cd chap1
# Changes directory to the chap1 folder.

# Step 6: Create a simple text file with some content
echo "My first chapter notes" > notes.txt
# Creates a text file named notes.txt with a line of text inside.

# Step 7: Check the current Git status
git status
# Shows which files are untracked, modified, or ready to be staged.

# Step 8: Stage all new and modified files
git add .
# Adds all changes (new files and folders) to the staging area for commit.

# Step 9: Commit your staged changes
git commit -m "Created chap1 folder with notes and README file"
# Saves your staged changes locally with a descriptive message.

# Step 10: Push your commits to GitHub
git push origin main
# Uploads (pushes) your committed changes to your GitHub main branch.

## ðŸ§  Conclusion
The results show that multiprocessing performs faster than multithreading for this CPU-intensive calculation.
This is because processes run on separate CPU cores, enabling true parallel execution, while threads share the same memory space and are limited by Pythonâ€™s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).

In summary, for CPU-bound tasks, multiprocessing is more efficient, whereas multithreading is better suited for I/O-bound operations such as reading files, handling network requests, or database operations.

Additionally, multiprocessing fully utilizes the available cores of a modern CPU, allowing heavy computations (like mathematical or data-processing tasks) to finish in significantly less time. However, it also comes with higher memory usage and inter-process communication overhead.

On the other hand, multithreading is lightweight, faster to start, and more memory-efficient â€” making it ideal for scenarios where multiple tasks need to wait for external events rather than continuously use the CPU.

Overall, choosing between multiprocessing and multithreading depends on the nature of the problem:

    Use multiprocessing for computationally heavy tasks that can be divided into independent parts.

    Use multithreading when tasks spend more time waiting than computing.

This experiment clearly demonstrates that understanding the type of workload is crucial to selecting the right parallelization strategy for maximum efficiency and performance.
